## PUSH_SWAP PROJECT
#### ABOUT PUSH_SWAP
Push_swap project consists in creating a program that is able to sort a serie
of integer numbers with the mininum number of moves.
The best your algorithm works, the higher your score will be.
The series of numbers given as input are handled as stacks and so the moves approved
represent ways to work with the numbers inside one stack and between stacks.
If you're interested more in this project you can give a look at different summaries
about the 42 subject on github (https://github.com/sshiling/42-push_swap).
My project has been evaluated with the maximum score.
###### ABOUT 42 FLORENCE
Push_swap is a project that helps you get in contact with algorithm basis
and learn how to implement your code, improving its efficiency according with your needs.
I wrote this code while attending at 42 Florence, an innovating programming school.
The course is mainly in C, but you get to explore C++, HTML, JavaScript and a little bit of Python,
thanks to the workshops and events that the school provides.
